#Weather App
A simple weather app that provides real-time weather information and forecast based on the user's location or a selected city. The app also features a user-friendly interface with a dynamic and interactive weather animation.

#Features
Current weather data: Displays the current temperature, weather condition (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy), and an appropriate weather animation.
Location-based weather: The app detects the user's current location and fetches weather data for that area.
City search: Users can search for weather data in other cities globally.
Custom weather animation: Animated weather icons that change based on weather conditions, providing a more engaging experience.
Permission handling: The app asks for location permissions from the user with options for precise or approximate location access.
